1705: 
    CycleGAN
    description of network architecture
    use mnist to validate their model works on a simpler task
1919: 
    DCNN
    architecture based on another paper
    use 3 datasets: MS-Celeb-1M, UMD Faces, IJB-C
TediGAN: (TediGAN: Text-Guided Diverse Face Image Generation and Manipulation)
    TediGAN based on StyleGAN
    architecture: https://github.com/IIGROUP/TediGAN
    related work: Text-to-image generation(maybe important for us), Text-Guided Image Manipulation, Image-Text Matching
    Datasets: celebA-HQ; FFHQ, (CUB(birds)), (COCO(landscape))
    metrics: FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance), LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), Accuracy, Realism (based on statements from 20 people)
    table3: higher acc and realism when not using celebA
