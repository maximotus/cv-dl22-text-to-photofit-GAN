# Experiments on CDCGAN
## 1. Training with original configuration on 1/4th of dataset
- [x] cdcgan-01.yaml 
- [x] cdcgan-01spectral.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-02.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-02spectral.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-03.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-03spectral.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-04.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-04spectral.yaml

## 2. Training on full dataset with best configurations
- [x] cdcgan-03spectral.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-04spectral.yaml

TODO collect results, i.e. loss, accuracies, images, scores of proposal sheet.

for paper: detailed description of dataset and it bias, maybe we want a mode collapse but not to early and pics should still be faces, celeba does not describe skin color, hair style, more hair color types, many more attributes(2x or more), noisy backgroup, not all faces face the same way(-> shadow)
