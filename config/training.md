# Experiments on CDCGAN
## 1. Training with original configuration on 1/4th of dataset
- [x] cdcgan-01.yaml 
- [] cdcgan-01spectral.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-02.yaml
- [ ] cdcgan-02spectral.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-03.yaml
- [ ] cdcgan-03spectral.yaml
- [x] cdcgan-04.yaml
- [ ] cdcgan-04spectral.yaml

## 2. Training on full dataset with best configurations


TODO collect results, i.e. loss, accuracies, images, scores of proposal sheet.

for paper: detailed description of dataset and it bias, maybe we want a mode collapse but not to early and pics should still be faces, celeba does not describe skin color, many more attributes(2x or more)
